                <p class="paragraph-medium">There is no shortage of popular choices when it comes to cloud storage. Cloud storage is safe way to back up files, save things for later and to collaborate with others. However, what happens when a user saves a file to one cloud storage application and then needs to transfer it to another?</p>
                <p class="paragraph-medium">While each individual cloud storage service may provide a good user experience, the experience starts to suffer when working across services. People tend to have multiple cloud accounts and working across them can be cumbersome and require multiple steps creating workflow friction.</p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-medium">
                  Focal eases this issue of cross platform workflow by providing a simple way to manage multiple cloud storage services from a central application. The user has the ability to search and manage files across third-party cloud storage service. Focal also implements a user friendly user interface that is similar to many cloud storage applications to ease the user learning process and increase adoption rates.</p>

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-large">To better understand the how users incorporate cloud storage into their digital lives I started my research by conducting a user survey sending it to public forums, my social media accounts and email contacts. I was looking to understand the context of how they use cloud storage and their pain points and motivations.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-medium">84% of the respondents indicated that they used cloud storage for personal or family organization. 68% of the those people also indicated that they use it for work. This indicated to me that people often have two different workflows that can further complicate how they use cloud storage.</p>

I started by analyzing the most popular cloud storage applications that were indicated in the user survey: Google Drive, Dropbox and Evernote. This also gave me more insight to the functionality and user flows that people would be familiar with. This would help inform the development of the user flows, UX, UI elements development later in the process.</p>
