            <p class="paragraph-large">Cloud storage has become an integral and ubiquitous part of people's lives and is used in a variety of contexts. From work to home and back again, people are using cloud storage to organize their digital lives and simplify collaboration between one another.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-medium">However, what happens when cloud storage becomes less of a solution and more of another thing to manage? How to do we simplify managing multiple, disparate storage drives?</p>
            <p class="paragraph-medium">This is where Focal Cloud storage comes in. Focal is a web application that allows users to manage multiple cloud storage accounts from a single origin point, allowing people to focus on their work and not their files.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-large">This project began as an open-ended request to identify an area of opportunity within the cloud storage market and develop a product that would serve that opportunity. To begin, I needed to understand two things, the cloud storage marketplace and how people incorporate cloud solutions into their lives.</p>

            <!-- User Research -->
            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-medium">Conducting the user survey was crucial in generating and uncovering issues that users are having. This part of the process also helped me to better understand how users are implementing cloud storage as a production tool.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-medium">One of the most interesting things that I discovered was that the majority (84 percent) of the respondents use at least two cloud storage services. This introduced further questions about how they manage using multiple accounts or services.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-medium">This provided insight into the functionality and features that people were already familiar with. In order to minimize the learning curve and increase adoption rates, many similar UI and user flows were adopted from these services.</p>

Before developing a brand it is important to understanding our competitors and how they present themselves. What areas of opportunities exist? How can our service differentiate from them?  In addition, it is also imperative to understand the user group and what they value and what their motivations are. From there, we can start to develop a meaningful brand personality and product that serves those users.</p>

            <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-medium">I conducted a few in-person and online usability tests and asked users to complete specific user stories and noted any issues or comments they had. During this time, I also performed informal user interviews on how they use cloud storage.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-medium">I then adjusted the wireframes based on feedback before moving on to applying the branding and developing the UI elements. Furtherer usability tests were conducted to ensure that there were no issues introduced into the design of the application.</p>

              <h4>Treat Focal as another drive</h4>
              <p class="paragraph-medium">I initially had the files that were saved to specifically to Focal listed out in the main dashboard for faster access. However, all three testers commented on making less of a distinction between the external storage drives and the files saved specifically to Focal. As one tester put it, “All storage is equal to me.” As a result, I simplified the initial dashboard screen by removing the file list and created a Focal tile within the My Drives section of the dashboard so accessing files saved to Focal would be the same as it would be for accessing linked drive files.</p>

              <h4>Creating a document contextually</h4>
              <p class="paragraph-medium">Creating a document is generally simple when using a specific service. However, since Focal allows access to multiple services, there was some confusion about which kind of document would be created. For example, users may want to create a Google Doc or a Dropbox Paper document. How can I create a Google Sheets document? Can I do that when I'm in Dropbox?</p>
              <p class="paragraph-medium">To resolve this, the user would be presented available drive-specific document types when they are working within that drive. So, when they working within their Google drive only Google-specific document options would appear.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-medium">During the second usability test, users were asking for a way to quickly perform certain tasks they do often, Those tasks included uploading, creating a document, and creating a folder. The initial interface on the mobile version already included bottom navigation and adding these tasks links increased the complexity and cognitive load of the screen. After rethinking this screen, the navigation was relocated to the navigational drawer which reduced the amount of choices users were presented so they could focus on the specific tasks they want to accomplish.</p>

People are very familiar with other cloud storage applications, so keeping functionality similar to what users already know reduces confusion (Jakob’s Law). I found this to be true while conducting user testing. Most of the people reviewed the functionality by comparing it to the other cloud storage applications they already used.</p>
          <p class="paragraph-medium">Providing too many options at the same time complicates usability. Simplify the interface as much as possible.</p>
          <p class="paragraph-medium">Future explorations of the service could include offering a desktop app to further simplify and integrate people's workflow.</p>
